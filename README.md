# Code test for React frontend developer position
In this folder you will find everything you need to complete the code test. In a real-life situation, the data to work with would need to be fetched from a server and possibly transformed. Since we want this code test to be runnable without an internet connection we have made a JSON dump of such a call and imported this into the project.

If you have any questions during the execution of the test, please feel free to send an e-mail to lasse.woien@wisecloud.se.

When you have completed the tests or the time is up, we would like you to send a zipfile with everything to lasse.woien@wisecloud.se
## The task at hand

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The task is to add a proof-of-concept for an actual feature on an app. This feature is the display and visualization of the statistics from a game of ice hockey.

Our designers have come up with the following sketch on what the feature should look like:

![Design Sketch](docs/design-sketch.png)

The actual data for a game is available in JSON format (imported on line 2 in App.js). See below for an explanation of the JSON format. We want you to represent the `recaps` of the game and have a drop down to select if it should show the statistics for the total game or for a specific period.

The team badges can be found in the assets folder and are imported in the components/GameHeader.js

### Limitations and considerations

* The proof-of-concept only needs to display statistics for a specific game (no need to have a dynamic URL).
* The exact font-families and colors can be different from the sketch (but try to get fairly close).
* The structure of the project can be modified. If you want to, you can re-generate or re-create the whole project from scratch.
* The UI should be responsive and work both on desktop computers and mobile phones.
* You can add other frameworks and packages if you would like to.
* The @testing-library packages are included with Create React App, but if deemed appropriate you are free to change into corresponding tests of your choice.
* The actual statistical indicators are not the same in the data as in the sketch. A list of common ice hockey statistics abbreviations can be found on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_statistics

### Nice to have
* If possible, make sure it works on the most common web browsers (e.g. Chrome, FireFox, IE11, Edge, Safari).
* Tests for implemented components/functions.
* Possibility to use a dynamic route for fetching which game to load (game ID 12771 is the default right now).
* TypeScript support for all components implemented.
